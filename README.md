ABBOT is *not* for production use.

The acronym (Ali Bharmal's Basic Optical Tomography) is also "meaningless" but does tell you what the original concept was: a set of tools/modules for investigating tomography in the context of astronomical adaptive optics.

It now also includes other concepts such as,
+ continuity analysis of wavefront slopes,
+ non-matrix reconstruction (HWR),
+ modal reconstruction,
+ Fourier-based Shack-Hartmann model

and usage of the modules within the 'apps' directory.
